## Fall-Detection
### This is a program to detect fall and not-fall events using SVM.

For Running Successfully:

1. Define the path to save the extracted features of fall and not-fall events from train videos.

2. Define the path to the train videos.

3. Define the paths to all extracted fall and not-fall features (new and old).

4. Define the path to save the trained svm.

#### Now we can use the trained svm to detect fall and not-fall ####

5. Define the path to the trained svm.

6. Define the path to a test video.

#### Note ####

To extract the features of fall and not fall events, press 'z' key.
