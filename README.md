# Fall-Detection
Fall Detection Using SVM

For Running Successfully:

1.define the path to save the extracted features of fall and not-fall from train video

2.define the path to the train video

3.define the paths to all extracted fall and not-fall features (new and old)

4.define the path to save the trained svm

Now we can use the trained svm to detect fall and not-fall

5.define the path to trained svm

6.define the path to test video
